# gmu-shortest-path

*Pain point*
During my first month at George Mason University , I found it difficult to get around campus... the only directions available are sign posts
(with the map drawn in, takes time) , using google maps (does not capture all the places in detail) or asking people (lack of accuracy). 


*Solution proposed*

Collate a list of lat,long points of interest on campus. 
Figure out shortest path from one location to another. 
Add searchable text by which people can search for places / people of interest. 


* Progress * 


- [x] Code to get list of points 
- [x] List of points
- [x] Code to get shortest distance between two points
- [x] Frontend wireframing 
- [ ] Add text to lat long values
- [ ] Code to implement searchable text
